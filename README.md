# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach and I love to code. A lot of my recent work has revolved around TypeScript and React or Node.js, but I have worked in many environments and I love to learn new things. Lately I've been immersed in learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and enjoying all the rewarding challenges that come with it. Let's connect and collaborate!
