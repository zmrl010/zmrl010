# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zach Riel and I love to solve problems with software. A lot of my recent work has revolved around [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), but I have experience in other environments and I love to learn new things. Lately I've been immersed in learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and enjoying all the rewarding challenges that come with it. Regardless of language or framework, I believe in **clean**, **tested**, and **documented** code. I strive to improve my code on those fronts at every opportunity I get.

When I'm not writing code or fixing bugs, you can often times find me playing bass. I also like to snowboard, play video games, or watch shows. I usually end up tinkering with some projects or learning something new in my spare time. I'm a huge nerd and I'm not ashamed of it.
